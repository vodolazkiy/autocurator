# autocurator
Automatically curate content with natural language processing for posting on social media.

My first full-fledged app, a simple bot that automatically pulls news stories related to selected categories, and then posts them to social media on a set schedule via threaded functions. 

Current version only supports Twitter.

To Do, in order of importance:

--A better summarizing algorithm. Status: in progress.

--External storage file or algorithmic population of recent content links to prevent repeats.

--LinkedIn integration

--Facebook integration
