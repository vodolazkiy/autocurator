# autocurator
Automatically curate content with natural language processing for posting on social media.

My first full-fledged app, a simple bot that automatically pulls news stories related to selected categories, and then posts them to social media on a set schedule via threaded functions. 

Current version only supports Twitter.

Next to-do: LinkedIn support.
Farther down the line: some original or at least more refined NLP than the one found in the newspaper library, which is adequate but can sometimes produce clunky summaries with more popular news sources. Problem with the library as far as I can tell is not the NLP algorithm but the web scraping picking up too much extraneous content and rich media metadata.
